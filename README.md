# language-quiz-bot
Chatbot that quizzes you on language vocabulary.

Because I don't like flashcard apps but I do like text interfaces, so... may as well try putting them together?

Current plans are to build a standalone application, but future projects might include converting it to an online chatbot accessible via messaging services or texts.

Currently it's just me working on this. Licensed under GNU GPL (see LICENSE.md)
